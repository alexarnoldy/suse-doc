= {CompanyName}(R) {ProductName} Integration with {CompanyName} {ProductName2} on {IHVPartner}(R) Platforms
{Author}, {CompanyName} < {AuthorEmail} >

== Use Case Overview
Quite often, the initial deployments of newly containerized microservices utilies simple, stateless APIs and functions. Yet, over time, as previous monolithic applications are migrated towards containers or as more complex service topologies are created, the need for stateful containers occurs. Due to the inherently resilient nature of container orchestration, having persistent volume stores that can be mounted where ever a container is launched then becomes a requirement. This can come either in the form of dynamically created volumes or for long-term retention persistent volumes. To address this, one of the best integrations between Kubernetes-based container-as-a-service infrastructure, like {CompanyName} {ProductName} is with Ceph-based software-defined storage infrastructure, such as {CompanyName} {ProductName2}.

=== Target Audience
This document is intended for IT decision makers, architects, system administrators and technicians who are implementing the combination of a flexible, Kubernetes-based, container-as-a-service platform and Ceph-based storage for persistent volumes. The reader should be familiar with all of the traditional pillars of IT infrastructures -- networking, computing and storage -- along with their specific, local use cases for sizing, scaling and limitations within their environments.

== Integration
As mentioned in the <<_use_case_overview>> section, requiring both dynamic and static volumes is key to running stateful containerized microservices. One agile method to accomplish that is to integrate a Kubernetes-based container-as-a-service solution, like {CompanyName} {ProductName} with a Ceph-based, software-defined storage solution, like {CompanyName} {ProductName2}. Coupling this with the inherent value-add and multiple {IHVPartner} system platform product lines yieldsagile, cost-effective and very performant options.

These software solutions have tested across several {IHVPartner} platforms with reference configurations available, listed on both the https://www.suse.com/partners/alliance/hpe/[{CompanyName}] and https://h22168.www2.hpe.com/us/en/partners/suse/[{IHVPartner}] alliance partner web sites.

NOTE: Any https://www.suse.com/yessearch/[{CompanyName} YES] certified {IHVPartner} platform can be used for the physical nodes of either solution's deployment, as long as the certification refers to the major version of the underlying {CompanyName} operating system required by the solution release.

=== Solution Prerequisites
Given the use case, the following software-defined solutions are assumed to be in place and running:

* {CompanyName} {ProductName}
* {CompanyName} {ProductName2}

While it is possible to implement the integration even with the basic, minimal configurations of each solution, the following additional best practices should be observed:

* Network and Network Services
Routable networks::
** an intranet or client-access network to access both solutions
** each solution should have a "public" network, likely routable to the other one and to any client-facing network, yet can be intranet, on-premise only. The integration access happens across this network
** an internet-facing network, if needed, to access cluster resources from beyond an organization's internal networks
Potentially non-routed networks::
** a Baseboard Management Control (BMC) network used to connect and control {IHVPartner} {IHVPartnerBMC} interfaces
** {CompanyName} {ProductName} has a pair of internal cluster networks, that can be non-routable outside the cluster, but do need to be sized according to the number of workload containers to be deployed
** {CompanyName} {ProductName2}, likewise also has a private network, which is used for backend data replication and should have capacity planned to address recovery and the number of replicas
Services::
As with most software-defined, cluster-based solutions, the following network services should be accessible:
** one or more valid Network Time Protocol (NTP) services, with all the cluster nodes configured to use this
** one or more valid Domain Name Service (DNS) services, with all the cluster nodes registered
** ensure access to software security updates and fixes by registering nodes to the http://scc.suse.com[SUSE Customer Center], or by creating a local https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/singlehtml/book_smt/book_smt.html[Subscription Management Tool] service.
** a reliable Load Balancer (LB), to provide high-availability access to core Kubernetes Master API functions. This could be implemented with any number of technologies, including simple, HAProxy software configurations.

* System Platform
For each of the software-defined solutions, ensure that each respective node not only meets the minimum requirements for that role, but also has the resource capacity to accommodate the expected number and type of workloads. These minimum guidelines are detailed in the respective solution deployment guides. For both solutions, performance and log monitoring capabilities can be deployed to help access the utilization metrics over time.

These prerequisites are summarized in the  following logical deployment diagram:

=== Integration Steps
The remainder of this document is meant as a companion guide to the official network, system and software product deployment documentation, citing specific settings as needed for this reference implementation. Default settings are assumed to be in use unless otherwise cited to accomplish the respective best practices and design decisions herein.

TIP: The prompt designated in the steps below help illustrate where to run each command and with what user access.

To create the necessary integration from a Kubernetes-based {CompanyName} {ProductName} cluster and a Ceph-based storage cluster like {CompanyName} {ProductName2}, first start on the {CompanyName} {ProductName2}.

* Log in to the respective Admin Node

* Collect the list of Monitor Node IP Addresses from '/etc/ceph/ceph.conf'

* Create and validate a dedicated storage pool (_e.g. "caasp-pool"_) for rbd-based applications using the following commands. Adjust the placement group size (_e.g. "512"_) as desired.

----
root@ses-admin # ceph osd pool create caasp-pool 512
root@ses-admin # ceph osd pool ls
root@ses-admin # ceph osd pool application enable caasp-pool rbd
root@ses-admin # ceph osd pool application get caasp-pool 
----

* Capture and encode the admin key, which will be used later

----
root@ses-admin # ceph auth get-key client.admin | base64
----

* Create a specific user (_e.g. "caasp"_) with necessary capabilities to utilize the "caasp-pool", then capture and encode user the key, which will be used later

----
root@ses-admin # ceph auth get-or-create client.caasp mon 'allow r' osd 'allow class-read object_prefix rbd_children, allow rwx pool=caasp-pool' -o ceph.client. caasp.keyring
root@ses-admin # ceph auth get-key client.caasp | base64
----

Then from the {CompanyName} {ProductName}, login to the respective Administration Node

* Create the file 'ceph-secret-admin.yaml'

[source, yaml]
----
# file - ceph-secret-admin.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: ceph-secret-admin
  namespace: default
type: "kubernetes.io/rbd"
data:
  key: #insert output string from client.admin encode step
----

* Apply and validate deployment of the file 'ceph-secret-admin.yaml'
----
root@caasp-admin # kubectl apply -f ceph-secret-admin.yaml
root@caasp-admin # kubectl get secrets
----

* Create the file 'ceph-secret-caasp.yaml'
[source, yaml]
----
# file - ceph-secret-caasp.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: ceph-secret-caasp
  namespace: default
type: "kubernetes.io/rbd"
data:
  key: #insert output string from client.caasp encode step
----

* Apply and validate file 'ceph-secret-caasp.yaml'
----
root@caasp-admin # kubectl apply -f ceph-secret-caasp.yaml
root@caasp-admin # kubectl get secrets
----

* Create the file 'ses-rbd-storage-class.yaml', using the Monitor Node IP addresses collected earlier
[source, yaml]
----
# file - ses-rbd-storage-class.yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: ses-rbd-sc
provisioner: kubernetes.io/rbd
parameters:
  monitors: <IPAddressMon1>:6789, <IPAddressMon2>:6789, <IPAddressMon3>:6789
  adminId: admin
  adminSecretName: ceph-secret-admin
  adminSecretNamespace: default
  pool: caasp-pool
  userId: caasp
  userSecretName: ceph-secret-caasp
----

* Apply and validate persistent volume claim file 'ses-rbd-persistent-volume-claim.yaml'
----
root@caasp-admin # kubectl apply -f ses-rbd-persistent-volume-claim.yaml
root@caasp-admin # kubectl get pvc <-n default>
----

Then to validate a working integration, create a simple container, like busybox, using the persistent volume claim. Refer to the "Creating Pods with Persistent Volumes" section of the https://www.suse.com/documentation/suse-caasp-3/[SUSE CaaS Platform Administration Guide].

As needed, both {CompanyName} {ProductName} and {CompanyName} {ProductName2} can be scaled with additional resource nodes to provide more capacity, capabilities, and performance. Such operations are described in the respective administration guides.

== Summary
At this point you should have a working integration between {CompanyName} {ProductName} and {CompanyName} {ProductName2}. Volumes for containerized workloads can now be utilized, as needed and made available to where ever in the Kubernetes cluster that the workload is deployed. Beyond providing the Ceph-based RBD persistent storage for stateful containers, this integration can also be utilized as the backing store for monitoring and performance logs, for tools like Prometheus, plus for the visualization tools, like Grafana, to access as well.
