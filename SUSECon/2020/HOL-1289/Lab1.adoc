== Start Your Engines
Deploy a complete, microservices-based application providing an end-to-end service to show the value of Kubernetes orchestration.

Goals / Objectives ( Estimated time 10-15 minutes )::
Easily launch, query, use and shutdown a complete set of containerized services -- implementing a full Wordpress instantiation.

Assumptions::
The example commands provided in this exercise use the full syntax and option names. In later exercises we will begin to show alternatives and other ways to launch, interact with and view what is running.

Environment::
The following diagram shows the basic infrastructure components of the lab environment which you will interact with.

[[img-Lab1-launch-app]]
.Application Launch Environment
image::Lab1-launch-app.png[Lab1-launch-app, 640, 480]

Process::
Login to your student workstation ( *<user>* : _{hostUID}_ , *<password>* : _{hostPW}_ )
+
* From the graphical user interface application dock at the bottom of your screen, launch a Terminal
+
[[img-env-terminal]]
.Environment Terminal Launch
image::env-terminal.png[env-terminal, 640, 480]
+
* In the terminal window, login to the lab environment's "Access Node" using secure shell (`ssh`) by typing
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
ssh {clusterUID}@{clusterAdmIP}
----
+
using the *<password>* _{clusterPW}_
+
NOTE: All of the following process steps should be completed while logged into this lab environment's "Access Node" as mentioned above!
+
* Exercise - Launch a complete application set
+
. From the "Access Node" command prompt, launch the application deployment by entering the following command
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
kubectl apply -k {Lab1-dir} <1>
----
<1> https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/[Overiew of kubectl]
+
 **QUIZ**
 How many lines of output resulted from this command?
+
. Let's do a quick discovery of each of the component types within your application deployment that you just launched
+
TIP: As a reference for what you just deployed, refer to https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateful-application/mysql-wordpress-persistent-volume/[Deploying WordPress and MySQL with Persistent Volumes].
+
[subs="attributes,verbatim"]
----
kubectl get secrets <1>
kubectl get services <2>
kubectl get deployments <3>
kubectl get persistentvolumeclaims <4>
kubectl get persistentvolumes
kubectl get pods <5>
----
<1> https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/[Kubernetes Secrets]
<2> https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/[Kubernetes Services]
<3> https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/[Kubernetes Deployments]
<4> https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/[Kubernetes Volumes]
<5> https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/[Kubernetes Pods]
+
 **QUIZ**
 a) How many "services" are running (besides kubernetes)? 
 b) How many "pods" are running ? 
+
** At this point you should begin to realize that you have deployed several components, with a single command, across most of the traditional IT pillars:
*** Network - a front-end loadbalancer
*** Compute - a web application (https://wordpress.org/[WordPress]) and a backing database (https://dev.mysql.com/[MySQL])
*** Storage - a backing volume store for each of your compute components
+
NOTE: These components are summarized in the figure below:
+
[[img-L1-application-deployment]]
.Application Deployment
image::WordPress-MySQL-Deployment.png[WordPress-MySQL-Deployment, 640, 480]
+
. Next, let's ensure that the necessary components are available and running
+
[subs="attributes"]

+
Then you can configure access to the deployment from the "Access Node" with a simple networking port forward command ( and leave it running in the background )
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
kubectl port-forward service/{Lab1-service} {Lab1-portLocal}:{Lab1-portPod}
Ctrl-z
bg
----
+
And you can now access and interact with your deployed service
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
w3m {Lab1-URL}:{Lab1-portLocal}/
----
+
Which should land you on the WordPress setup page. Feel free to walk through any number of steps.
+
. Now you can now quit "q" the text-based `w3m` browser, shutdown the port forward, and delete/stop all of these deployed components
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
fg
Ctrl-c
kubectl delete -k {Lab1-dir}
----
+
Then validate that the main application deployment components are gone (beyond the core Kubernetes service)
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
kubectl get services
----
+
IMPORTANT: *_Congratulations !_* Now you can see the initial appeal of what Kubernetes offers, by simply leveraging the predominant command-line interface (CLI) tool, `kubectl` ( which interfaces with the Kubernetes cluster manager ) to do what you want to do in a very easy fashion.
+
* *_Optional / Advanced Exercises_* - If you have some spare time, or are curious about the commands used or what was deployed, try:
+
** Explore the available functionality of the `kubectl` command, many of which you will be using in later exercises, for almost all the relevant interactions with Kubernetes
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
kubectl help | more
----
+
** Review the manifest content and format used to descriptively manage the resources you need deployed in Kubernetes
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
more {Lab1-dir}/*.yaml
----
+
** Learn more about the `-k` argument to leveraging Kubernetes https://kustomize.io/[kustomize]

Knowledge Check::
Initial introduction to `kubectl` and leveraging it to
+
* deploy multiple microservices with a single command
* get the status of those microservices, using a variation of that single command
* destroy the running set of microservices, again using a variation of that single command
