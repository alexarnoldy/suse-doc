== Start Your Engines (precede with slides, 5 minutes)
Create a simple deployment (with multiple containers) providing an end-to-end service to show the value of Kubernetes orchestration.

* Goal / Objectives - Launch a complete Wordpress instantiation ( 5-15 minutes)

* Process::
Login to your system ( user : {hostUID} , password: {hostPW} )
+
** From the graphical user interface's application dock, launch a terminal
+
[[img-env-terminal]]
.Environment Terminal Launch
image::env-terminal.png[env-terminal, 640, 480]
+
** In the terminal window, login to the demo environment by typing
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
ssh {clusterUID}@{clusterAdmIP}
----
+
using the password "*{clusterPW}*"
+
NOTE: All of the following process steps should be completed while logged into this demo environment as noted above!
+
** Exercise - Launch a complete application deployment
. From the command prompt, type
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
kubectl apply --filename="{Lab1-dir}/{Lab1-manifest}"
----
+
. Get a glimpse of what you just launched, via
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
kubectl get pods -o wide
----
+
 **QUIZ** How many microservice pods are running?
+
. Launch a web browser and access the following URL
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
{Lab1-URL}
----
+
. Stop all of these deployed microservices, via
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
kubectl delete --filename="{Lab1-dir}/{Lab1-manifest}"
----
+
And validate that they are gone, via
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
kubectl get pods
----
+
and refreshing your browser window.
+
IMPORTANT: *_Woohoo !_* Now you can see the initial appeal of what Kubernetes offers, by simply leveraging the predominant CLI tool, `kubectl` ( which controls the Kubernetes cluster manager ).

NOTE: The example commands provided in this exercise used the full syntax and option names. In later exercises we will show the alternatives and other ways to launch, interact with and view what is running.

* If you have some spare time, or are curious about the command used or what was deployed, try:
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
man kubectl
kubectl --help
man kubectl-get
cat {Lab1-dir}/{Lab1-manifest}
----
+

// <1> As a reference, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateful-application/mysql-wordpress-persistent-volume/[Sample].

* Knowledge Check: 
** Initial introduction to `kubectl` and leveraging it to
*** deploy multiple microservices with a single command
*** get the status of those microservices, using a variation of that single command
*** destroy the running set of microservices, again using a variation of that single command
