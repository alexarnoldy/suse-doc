Proof-of-Concept::
Quite often, one of the first attempts for a project is the setup of proof-of-concept, to:
* research various alternatives
* learn about the targeted, project components
* evaulate the factors (availability, performance, security, integrity) in the context of the current ecosystem or the next generation one
* get feedback from potential stakeholders to address feasibility for next iteration of evaulation or production
