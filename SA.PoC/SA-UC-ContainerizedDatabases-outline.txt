Solution Architecture
=====================

Preface

I. Introduction

II. Strategy
	* Categories : SQL noSQL
		Why - reason to adopt this solution approach

III. Business Case
	* Factors - Availability, Performance, Security, Integrity
		Who - to engage with, the targeted audience for this document
		What - areas of project focus
		When - target ETA and potential iterative phases

IV. Application
	* MSSQLServer, EnterpriseDB, MariaDB
	* Redis, InfluxDB
	* Flavors - PoC, Production, Scale
		With - often likely ISV related completion of stack
			e.g. backend storage, backup/recovery options
				ISV partners

V. Technology
		How - core infrastructure layers to provide necessary APIs
			e.g. container runtime, K8s, CNI,
				volumes, CSI (SC, PVC, PV)
VI. Physical
		Where - options for underlying infrastructure
			e.g. virtualization, physical/baremetal
				IHV/CSP partner

VII. Migration
		Steps to move from
			- existing -> new, retire old versions
			- version -> newer version, patch/updates across stack
			- locale -> another
