{IHVPartner} {IHVPlatform} {IHVPlatformComposer}::
{IHVPartner} {IHVPlatform} {IHVPlatformComposer} is the primary appliance for managing Synergy systems. This
hardware appliance is powered by HPE OneView and is designed with hardware failover, allowing a redundant
Composer appliance to take over control and keep your critical infrastructure up and running.
* provides the enterprise-level management to compose and deploy system resources to your application needs. This management appliance uses software-defined intelligence to aggregate compute, storage, and fabric resources in a manner that scales to your application needs, instead of being restricted to the fixed ratios of traditional resource offerings.
* {IHVPartner} {IHVPlatform} template-based provisioning enables fast time to service with a single point for defining compute module state, pooled storage, network connectivity, and boot image.
* is a comprehensive unifying management interface designed for converged infrastructure management. A unifying platform increases the productivity of every member of the internal IT team across servers, storage, and networking. By streamlining processes, incorporating best practices, and creating a new holistic way to work, HPE OneView provides organizations with a more efficient way to work. It is designed for open integration with existing tools and processes to extend these efficiencies.
* is instrumental for the deployment and management of {IHVPartner} servers and enclosure networking. It collapses infrastructure management tools into a single resource-oriented architecture that provides direct access to all logical and physical resources of the solution. Logical resources include server profiles and server profile templates, enclosures and enclosure groups, and logical interconnects and logical interconnect groups. Physical resources include server hardware blades and rack servers, networking interconnects, and computing resources.
* offers a uniform console for administrators to interact with resources by providing a RESTful API foundation. The RESTful APIs enable administrators to utilize a growing ecosystem of integrations to further expand the advantages of the integrated resource model that removes the need for the administrator to enter and maintain the same configuration data more than once and keep all versions up to date. It encapsulates and abstracts many underlying tools behind the integrated resource model, so the administrator can operate with new levels of simplicity, speed, and agility to provision, monitor, and maintain the solution.
