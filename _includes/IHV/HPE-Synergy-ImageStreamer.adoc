* can quickly provision an operating environment across a large number infrastructure blocks or nodes. It can deploy and update many systems quickly, possibly as fast of you can reboot servers, to quickly expand or change environments. This management capability is implemented using redundant physical appliances for production environments to maintain high availability in operations.
