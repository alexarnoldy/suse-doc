{Author}, {CompanyName} < {AuthorEMail} >

This process outlines how to setup and prepare the required infrastructures services to run the various {CompanyName} solutions in the {IHVPartner} {IHVPartnerEnv}.

== Infrastructure Services
The following infrastructure services are needed to have a complete environment for deployment of other solutions:
* Environment Parameters
* IP Subnet Layout
* Repository Mirroring Tool

=== Repository Mirroring Tool [RMT]
In order to have a local, synced repository of the required {CompanyName} Customer Center [SCC] content (for quick/easy access), the best practice is to have an RMT server running.

After connecting via the VPN and logging into the jumphost, visit the vSphere Web Client, then follow the steps below:

. follow the Virtual Machine Setup Process, adjusting these virtual hardware settings:
* name = RMT
* CPU = 1
* Memory = 1GB
* Hard disk = 48GB

. Follow the SLE Setup Process to install the operating system, with the following adjusted parameter values
* _Network Card Setup_ for (eth0)
** refer to general <<_environment_parameters>> and RMT-specific values in <<_ip_subnet_layout>>
* Registration
** Register System to scc.suse.com
** using a suitable email address and registration code
** enable update repositories

. After the installation completes, the VM reboots, then login
* Follow the https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP1/single-html/SLES-rmt/#book-rmt[Repository Mirroring Tool Guide] to complete the installation and configuration
* Once this setup is complete, enable the mirroring of the following content:
** `rmt-cli product list --all | grep "{ProductNameOSVer}"` to obtain a list of available products
** `rmt-cli product enable <ID>` for each of those returned by the previous command
** then search the output of `rmt-cli product list --all` and enable the following products
*** {CompanyName} {ProductNameContainer} (Version {ProductNameContainerVer})
*** {CompanyName} {ProductNameStorage} (Version {ProductNameStorageVer})
** Then mirror all of the content with `rmt-cli mirror`

At this point you are ready to utilize the RMT node as a registration server for all other {CompanyName} product deployments
