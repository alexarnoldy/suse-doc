== Required Demo Infrastructure

These necessary infrastructure service components have been previously setup and should be operational. Most all of these services should remain running at all times and configuration values should remain static so as not to impact the deployments or operational aspects.

Prerequisite Services::
This section outlines required background services for this document's {CompanyName} solution within the {IHVPartner} {IHVPartnerEnv} environment. It also provides rudimentary checks to verify the services and some simple troubleshooting examples.

=== Internet Access
In order to access components and downloads from ouside the {IHVPartner} {IHVPartnerEnv} environment, it is assumed that outbound Internet access is available, likely through the Demo Subnet Router.
