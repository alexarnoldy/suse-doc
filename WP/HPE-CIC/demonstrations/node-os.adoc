=== Node Operating System Install

Purpose::
This section outlines how to install the base {CompanyName} {ProductNameOS} {ProductNameOSVer} on an available virtual machine node in a fairly automated fashion for the various roles of the {CompanyName} solutions in the {IHVPartner} {IHVPartnerEnv}.

NOTE: This document only cites values or inputs which need to be changed from the defaults. Refer to the node roles of {CompanyName} solutions, as that respective document calls out further exceptions to this process. 

TIP: Refer to the respective https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP1/single-html/SLES-deployment/#book-sle-deployment[{CompanyName} {ProductNameOS} {ProductNameOSVer} Deployment Guide] for further details. 

==== Install the base operating system

From the JumpHost, launch the Google Chrome browser to connect to the vSphere HT
ML5 Web Client, then follow the steps below:

TIP: For a recorded example video representative of this process, view video::https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bi4S6KtxAHgSRH0DHbQ2Jpyk3apBJ2a8[{CompanyName} {ProductNameContainer} Management Workstation Operating System Install]. Of course, all of the cluster nodes can be installed in parallel as well.

. Right click on the respective virtual machine and _Open Remote Console_
. Power On the virtual machine
+
TIP: If this is a re-install of the given virtual machine, you likely need to hit *ESC* during the boot startup to ensure you can boot from _CD-ROM Drive_ media.
+
* On the install boot screen, use the arrow key to select _Installation_ on the boot screen
+
NOTE: Refer to specific DNS IP Subnet networking settings from the <<_domain_name_service_dns>>
+
* In the _Boot Options_ input field, create a temporary network configuration to access the unattended installation (autoYaST) file
+
NOTE: Within the {IHVPartner} {IHVPartnerEnv} you can view the contents of the respective solution node role's autoYaST file via a web browser to review what configuration is being setup and installed by accessing the URL - http://rmt.suse.cic/repo/autoYaST/.
+
** ifcfg=INTERFACE=IP_LIST,GATEWAY_LIST,NAMESERVER_LIST,DOMAINSEARCH_LIST autoyast=URL/PathToFile.xml
+
ifeval::["{DemoTarget}" == "CaaSPlatform"]
** As an example, for this solution, use of the spare IPs and enter
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
ifcfg=eth=10.6.64.208/24,10.6.64.1/{rmtIP},suse.cic autoyast=http://{rmtIP}/repo/autoYaST/role.{domainNameContainer}.xml
----
+
endif::[]

At this point, the operating system will install has finished, the node will reboot and the automated post-install configuration will be applied.

==== Verify the operating system installation

From the JumpHost, launch the Google Chrome browser to connect to the vSphere HT
ML5 Web Client, then follow the steps below:

TIP: For a recorded video of the post-install process, view video::https://drive.google.com/open?id=1T-AzT1Nz4Jx4sW8P-1Q4wm43tEB_kA8I[{CompanyName} {ProductNameContainer} Master Node Post-Install].

. Right click on the respective virtual machine and _Open Remote Console_
* Login, via root, to the node and perform these few verifications and adjustments:
** Check the output of
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
ip a
----
+
*** To ensure a match with the expected network interface IPAddress
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
ip r
----
+
*** To ensure a matching setup for the network routing
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
host rmt.{domainName}
----
+
*** To access to the local DNS mapping service
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
hostname -f
----
+
*** To ensure a matching setup for the fully-qualified domain name of this host
+
NOTE: This can be remedied by check the contents of the file(s): `/etc/hostname` to make sure it matches the intended fully-qualified node's Hostname and `/etc/hosts` which can have an entry added for the fully-qualified node's hostname
+
** Run
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
yast2
----
+
** Selecting _Software_
*** Then _Product Registration_
**** Select _Register System via local SMT Server_
**** Input the appropriate _Local Registration Server URL_ to the RMT server (e.g. http://rmt.{domainName}/) then *Next*
**** Add the respective _Extensions and Modules_ for the desired role - may need to uncheck the _Hide Development Versions_
+
ifeval::["{DemoTarget}" == "CaaSPlatform"]
{CompanyName} {ProductNameContainer} {ProductNameContainerVer} x86_64
endif::[]
ifeval::["{DemoTarget}" == "EnterpriseStorage"]
{CompanyName} {ProductNameStorage} {ProductNameStorage} x86_64
endif::[]
+
then *Next*
+
NOTE: Refer to the respective https://documentation.suse.com[{CompanyName} Solution Deployment Guides] for the required extensions/modules.
+
**** Read and _Accept_ any additional license agreements, then *Next*
**** _Accept_, _Ok_ and _Finish_ any recommended package installations
ifeval::["{DemoTarget}" == "CaaSPlatform"]
*** Then _Software Management_
**** Change _Filter_ to _Patterns_ search for and verify the respective ones for the target role are installed
***** for adm role - _{CompanyName} {ProductNameContainer} Management_
***** for other roles - _{CompanyName} {ProductNameContainer} Node_
+
Then _Accept_ and _OK_ and _Finish_
endif::[]
+
*** Then _Online Update_
**** Peruse all available updates then _Accept_ and _OK_ and _Finish_ and _Close_ and _OK_ and _Quit_

At this point, the node should be manually rebooted to ensure application of all the updates.  After that the node should be ready for operational usage and inclusion into the solution cluster.
