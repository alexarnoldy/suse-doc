== Introduction
Digital transformation has led to the need to consolidate multiple sources of structured and unstructured data to fill the data pipeline required to build today's analytics based applications.  Common use cases include machine learning, business analytics, Internet of Things (IOT) sensor data for manufacturing, and even fraud protection for financial services.  This causes challenges in pulling data from all kinds of sources including on-premise databases, hadoop clusters, real-time click streams, and geographically disperse public cloud systems.  Further, the need for security and governance makes managing these services cumbersome and inflexible.   https://www.sap.com/products/data-hub.html[{ISVPartner} {ISVSolution}] greatly simplifies the management of all of your data sources with a simple "drag and drop" interface to build your end-to-end data pipeline with fine-grained access control. This unique application works both with and without SAP's other software products.

In what is likely to become a trend for new SAP applications, SAP Data Hub is designed to be installed and run in a Kubernetes/container environment.   https://www.suse.com/products/caas-platform/[{CompanyName} {ProductName}] (Containers-as-a-Service) is one of several SAP-certified Kubernetes platforms approved for production supported environments. The benefits of this approach are easy scalablity, portablity between environments, and isolated troubleshooting.

NOTE: See [.underline]*SAP Note 2693555* for SAP Data Hub certified systems

Fortunately, SAP offers many different ways to evaluate Data Hub ranging from free downloadable evaluation versions that run in a small environment all the way up to fully automated Kubernetes clusters.   This paper will outline the benefits of each method to provide guidance on the best evaluation criteria to consider.


=== Target Audience
This discussion will be of interest to professionals involved in both IT Operations and Analytics/Business Intelligence.   The recommended frameworks offer a range of solutions depending on your Proof of Concept goals and requirements.
