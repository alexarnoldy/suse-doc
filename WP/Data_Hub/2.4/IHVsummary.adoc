This reference defines a private proof-of-concept cluster.  Other guides will address cloud-based and production environments.  The proof-of-concept cluster is a starting point for prototyping real-world applications that are meant to go into production.  As such, a proof-of-concept cluster can easily be grown into a production environment.  Further, a private deployment is useful for secure, in-house prototyping, but is not restricted from using cloud-based applications and data.  SAP Data Hub can manage data from locations both behind the firewall and in the cloud.

The backbone of the application environment is the Kubernetes cluster, as implemented in the {CompanyName} {ProductName} software.  As described in the architecture section above, this cluster can be implemented on low-cost, commodity hardware, typicall 1U racked boxes with 2-socket processors.  The application environment reflects a key aspect of growth from prototyping to production.  In a PoC, there are typically few application containers, as developers are gaining experience building, deploying, and managing code as containers on the new software environment.  As such, there are less demands on the hardware for resources, particularly main memory.  Memory can easily be expanded, as the cluster needs to grow.  Processor speed, on the other hand, is something to carefully consider.  It is not as easy to swap processors, so choosing a medium to high-end Xeon processor with many cores is a good idea.

It is recommended to start with a minimum 2-socket Xeon processor with 8 to 12 cores per CPU.  Memory can start at 64GB.  Local storage on the cluster is used primarily for the operating system and any application temporary data.  A common choice is a RAID1 configuration of operating system disks, each with a minimum of 256GB.  SSD is the recommended choice, as it speeds operations and doesn't add considerable cost to the cluster in this case.  Networking is another key performance area, so 10GbE NICs are a minimum recommendation.  You can start with 1 NIC, but that is a bare minimum and 2 or more NICs will be needed for specific network requirements, based on your application needs.  In particular, high-bandwidth data pipelines will move lots of data to the cluster storage and can easily saturate a single NIC.  Consider mapping 1 high-speed NIC to those storage requirements.

As described in the {CompanyName} {ProductName} section above, a minimum of 5 nodes will be required: 1 as the administration node, 1 master node, and 3 worker nodes.  Any https://www.suse.com/yessearch/[{CompanyName} YES] certified {IHVPartner} platform can be used for the physical nodes of this deployment, as long as the certification refers to the major version of the underlying {CompanyName} operating system required by the {CompanyName} {ProductName} release.
