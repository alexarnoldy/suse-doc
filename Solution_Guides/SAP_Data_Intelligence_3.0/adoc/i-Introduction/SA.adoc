The growth in the amount of business data being collectected continues to accelerate, making utilizing it as much of a challenge as it is an opportunity. While companies are discovering ways to transform their data into products and services that differentiate their business and create new lines of revenue,increasingly they are finding it difficult to fully capitalize on the many datasets they have available to them. At the same time they are coping with the increased cost of managing information that are stored in many, disparate data silos (e.g., cloud databases, Hadoop clusters, social media feeds). Moreover, maintaining large collections of data adds complexity to their business due to requirements for security, governance, and specialized training. In this light it is not hard to understand a recent estimation that 70% of data businesses collected is never utilized.
