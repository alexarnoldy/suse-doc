= QuickStart for using AsciiDoc with DAPS

== Use comments

 // One Line

 ////
 Lots
 of
 Comments
 ////



== Headlines

Use = for the headlines, because you see easily the structure

----
= Document Title
== 1 headline for Chapter
=== 2 headline for Subchapter
==== 3 headline
----



== Listing Block for commands within the text

ONLY use the style of "listing" block, NO OTHER

 ----
 example command
 ----

----
example command
----

Do NOT use the optional title for the block, nor styles to conflict with DAPS.

== Variables

Make use of variables if it is useful

:myVariable: ThisIsTheContent
Declaration

 :myVariable: ThisIsTheContent

Usage

 {myVariable}

{myVariable}

Usage within listing blocks needs to be allowed as normally listing provides text "as it is"

 [subs="attributes"]
 ----
 {myVariable}
 ----

[subs="attributes"]
----
{myVariable}
----

or if you want also formatting

 [subs="attributes,quotes"]
 ----
 this is some text and **{myVariable}**
 ----

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
this is some text and **{myVariable}**
----

Sometimes you need double formatting characters:
double asterisks around one or more **l**etters in a word make those letters bold which you also need inside of blocks



== Inclusion of other documents 

Usage

 include::common.adoc[]

include::common.adoc[]

DON'T use headlines in these include files, leave the headline placeholders in your main document

// There is a command for that , but i did not tried it out :leveloffset: 1   -> pushes titles down one level



== Inclusion of images

 image::suse_logo_w-tag_black.png[]

image::suse_logo_w-tag_black.png[]

Images needs to be in the subdirectory ./images if you would like to use DAPS relative to your document

== Conditional 

Ability to adjust content based upon

* a defined variable, like providing paths to view images on line if using GitHub via browser (can also do the contrary via ifndef)

 ifdef::env-github[]
 :imagesdir: https://github.com/bwgartner/suse-doc/blob/master/AsciiDoc/images/src/png/
 endif::[]

* or based upon their values

 ifeval::["{myVariable}" == "ThisIsTheContent"]
 TaDa !
 endif::[]

ifeval::["{myVariable}" == "ThisIsTheContent"]
Tada !
endif::[]



== HTML links are automatic

Follow me to http://www.suse.com[] Or to http://www.suse.com[SUSE Homepage]



// == Do not use the . style for Paragraphs
// .text text

// as it destroys all other formatting with DAPS
// even if they work well in asciidoc direct output



== Useful paragraphs with icons
Which could also as multi-line block

== Lists
 
Bulleted

----
* asdfasdf
** asdfsadf
*** asdfsadf
----

* asdfasdf
** asdfsadf
*** asdfsadf

Ordered

----
. number    1
. number    2 
.. letter   a
.. letter   b 
. number    3
----

. number    1
. number    2 
.. letter   a
.. letter   b 
. number    3


== Tables

 ----
 [options="header,footer"]
 |===
 |Col 1|Col 2      |Col 3
 |1    |Item 1     |a
 |2    |Item 2     |b
 |===
 ----

[options="header,footer"]
|===
|Col 1|Col 2      |Col 3
|1    |Item 1     |a
|2    |Item 2     |b
|===

There are more very flexible and other possibilities for tables



== That is it for the content AsciiDoc-based source - you do not need more - really simple

Then to convert to XML (which is the base for DAPS)
`../bin/adoc2xml.sh quickstart.adoc`

To create common output formats

HTML (and review via browser ./build/quickstart/single-html/quickstart/)
`../bin/xml2daps-single-html.sh quickstart.adoc`

PDF (and review via evince ./build/quickstart/quickstart_color_en.pdf)
`../bin/xml2daps-pdf.sh quickstart.adoc`

Common editors (plus many more):
vi / vim / gvim / atom

=== TIPS

DAPS build structure:
 +<--- dir with the documents
 |
 |quickstart.adoc  -> main document
 |
 |common_copyright_gfdl.adoc              -> includes
 |common_intro_feedback.adoc
 |common_intro_typografie.adoc
 |
 |DC-quickstart    -> DAPS jobs files
 |
 +- images
 |    +-src
 |      +-dia
 |      +-eps
 |      +-fig
 |      +-pdf
 |      +-png
 |      +-svg                            -> pictures (best only use svg)
 |
 |
 + xml   <- dir with the docbook xml 
 |
 + build  <- final output file
