= QuickStart for using AsciiDoc with DAPS

== Use comments

 // One Line

 ////
 Block
 ////



== Headlines

Use = for the headlines, because you see easily the structure

----
= Document Title
== 1 headline for Chapter
=== 2 headline for Subchapter
==== 3 headline
----



== Variables

Make use of variables if it is useful

Declaration

 :myVariable: ThisIsTheContent

Usage

 {myVariable}

Usage within listing blocks needs to be allowed as normally listing provides text "as it is"

 [subs="attributes"]
 ----
 {myVariable}
 ----

or if you want also formatting

 [subs="attributes,quotes"]
 ----
 this is some text and **{myVariable}**
 ----

Sometimes you need double formatting characters:
double asterisks around one or more **l**etters in a word make those letters bold which you also need inside of blocks



== Listing Block for commands within the text

ONLY use the style of "listing" block, NO OTHER

 ----
 example command
 ----

as OTHERS style destroy all other formatting with DAPS even if the work well in asciidoc direct output

Do NOT use the optional title for the block.



== Include of other documents 

Usage

 include::common.adoc[]

include::common.adoc[]

DON'T use headlines in these include files, leave the headline placeholders in your main document

// There is a command for that , but i did not tried it out :leveloffset: 1   -> pushes titles down one level



== Include of images

 image::suse_logo_w-tag_black.png[]

image::suse_logo_w-tag_black.png[]

Images needs to be in the subdirectory ./images if you would like to use DAPS relative to your document



== html links are automatic

Follow me to http://www.suse.com[] Or to http://www.suse.com[SUSE Homepage]



== Do not use the . style for Paragraphs
.text text

as it destroys all other formatting with DAPS
even if they work well in asciidoc direct output



== Useful paragraphs with icons
   which could also as mulit-line block
   NOTE:
   TIP: 
   IMPORTANT:
   WARNING:
   CAUTION:



== Text styles
 normal, _italic_, *bold*, +mono+.
 ``double quoted'', `single quoted'.
 ^super^, ~sub~.



== special characters

 (C) (R) (TM)



== Lists
 
Bulleted

* asdfasdf
** asdfsadf
*** asdfsadf

Ordered

. number    1
. number    2 
.. letter   a
.. letter   b 
. number    3



== Tables

[options="header,footer"]
|===
|Col 1|Col 2      |Col 3
|1    |Item 1     |a
|2    |Item 2     |b
|===


There are more very flexible and other possibilities for tables



==  Thats it - you do not need more - really simple

maybe have a look at
http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/

=== TIPS

DAPS build structure:
 +<--- dir with the documents
 |
 |quickstart.adoc  -> main document
 |
 |common_copyright_gfdl.adoc              -> includes
 |common_intro_feedback.adoc
 |common_intro_typografie.adoc
 |
 |DC-quickstart    -> DAPS jobs files
 |
 +- images
 |    +-src
 |      +-dia
 |      +-eps
 |      +-fig
 |      +-pdf
 |      +-png
 |      +-svg                            -> pictures (best only use svg)
 |
 |
 + xml   <- dir with the docbook xml 
 |
 + build  <- final output file

To convert to XML (which is the base for DAPS)
../bin/adoc2xml.sh quickstart.adoc

To create common output formats

HTML (and review via browser ./build/quickstart/single-html/quickstart/
../bin/xml2daps-single-html.sh quickstart.adoc

PDF (and review via evince ./build/quickstart/quickstart_color_en.pdf)
../bin/xml2daps-pdf.sh quickstart.adoc

Common editors:
vi / vim / gvim
atom ... and tons more
